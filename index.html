    // "Must have at least 5 commits not including initial commit 
    // Use math.random from 0-10 math.random will be eused to generate the number. Testing ship accuracy, 
    // Our ship has an accuracy of 0.7 the alien ship will be generated with math.random to see if the player hits." -->
    // #### Setting up our project directory
    // 1. Create a project directory `$ mkdir yourname-mid-mod-1`
    // 2. `$ cd yourname-mid-mod-1`
    // 3. `$ touch index.html app.js` 
    // #### Guide to get started 
    // ##### 1 Player game 
    // - USS Schwarzenegger (User)
    //   - Attacks first 
    //   - Is able to retreat 
    //   - Hull: 20
    //   - Firepower: 5
    //   - Accuracy: 7
    // - 6 Alien ships (Computer)
    //   - Hull: 3-6
    //   - Firepower: 2-4
    //   - Accuracy: .6 - .8
    //   - <b>Weakness</b> They attack one at a time 
    //   - <b>Hull (AKA hitpoints):</b>  If hull reaches 0 or less, the ship is destroyed
    //   - <b>Firepower:</b> Amount of damage done to the hull of the target with a successful hit 
    //   - <b>Accuracy: </b> is the chance between 0-1 that the ship will hit its target
    //       - Everytime the ship will attack, calculate the chance that the damage will hit the opposing ship using `Math.random` 
    //       - If the ships accuracy is greater than `0.8`than the attack is missed
    //       - If the ships accuracy is less than or equal to `0.8` the attack will be successful 
    // #### Functionality pseudocode
    // - Welcome to the game 
    // - User starts the game
    // - User can click attack! 
    // - If alien ship isn't attacked then it is the alien's turn
    // - If the user survives the alien attack then User can `attack` or `retreat`
    // - If user retreats the game is over
    
    // This is the beginning of the Space_games javaScript code
